Exactly What I Need From Krystal:

- WHITE icons, not black
– All background images (different pictures of food)
– Specific flow for asking students which university they attend
– Flow for making sure that their email matches the university
– Flow for the Seller receiving a notification that someone is interested in purchasing

If I can't get PDFs (instead of SVGs), then I need PNG files, 1x, 2x, and 3x.
